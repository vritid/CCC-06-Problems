Input Specifications: 
The program should prompt the user for a number for each type of item then calculate and display
the Calorie total. You may assume that each input will be a number from 1 to 4. That is, each
customer has to pick exactly one number from each of the four options out of each of the four
categories

Output Specifications:
The program prints out on the screen the total Calories of the selected meal, and stops executing
after this output.
